    <p> After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Music Composition,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        I immediately entered into a second career in telecommunications.<br>
        Music is my passion. I am also a songwriter, and an audio engineer.</p>
      
    <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had recently taken computer networking and software courses online.<br> 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I developed a growing interest in web design and software development,<br>
        and began to take notice to a growing demand in my marketplace.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
         &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, I'm a Full Stack Developer Student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful,</a> and it has opened<br> 
        up a whole new world to me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>
       
      <p> &nbsp;If you're looking for a new developer, someone who would be devoted <br>
        (or someone who you would want to try out some new ideas with),&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
         &nbsp; &nbsp;feel free to contact me. Let's create some code and change the world!!!</p>
