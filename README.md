### About Daniel

After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Music Composition,     
I immediately entered into a second career in telecommunications.  
Music is my passion. I am also a songwriter, and an audio engineer.    

I had recently taken computer networking and software courses online.  
I developed a growing interest in web design and software development,      
and began to take notice to a growing demand in my marketplace.    
Now, I'm a Full Stack Developer Student at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com), and it has opened  
up a whole new world to me.  

If you're looking for a new developer, someone who would be devoted  
(or someone who you would want to try out some new ideas with),       
feel free to contact me. Let's create some code and change the world!!!
